# Task Modify

Adapt the code so that:
- As well checking whether the answer is too high or too low, add code that checks whether the guess is equal to the answer and if it isn’t, displays a “Bad luck” message
- The user is then asked whether they guessed correctly, which the user can respond 'yes or 'no' to
- If they respond 'yes', then display a “Well done” message
- If they respond 'no' then display a “Never mind” message
- If they respond dishonestly, then display a message that reflects this


- Add comments to explain what you have changed.

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:

- a colon at the end of each if and else line.
- each branch is indented unsing the TAB key (not just spaces)
- no condition after 'else'
- a **double** equals in the condition when chcking that two pieces of data are the same.
